            Men of the Night's Watch are divided between three different orders:
            the Rangers, the Builders, and the Stewards. Each order is led by
            its own officer, each appointed by the Lord Commander of the Night's
            Watch: the First Ranger, First Builder, and First Steward.
          </p>

          <ul class="structure__ul">
            <li>
              Rangers - the true warriors of the Night's Watch. While all black
              brothers are expected to have some basic arms training and to take
              up a sword in defense of the Wall itself, the Rangers are the ones
              who are sent on dangerous scouting expeditions beyond the Wall, to
              track wildlings movements. When the Watch was more numerous in
              past centuries they formed the core fighting group sent to destroy
              large wildling warbands who attempted to pass south of the Wall.
            </li>
            <li>
              Builders - who physically maintain the structures of the Night's
              Watch, and repair the Wall itself.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stewards - who provide for the day-to-day needs of the Watch:
              gathering, cooking, and serving food, repairing clothes and
              equipment, tending to the horses and messenger-ravens, and
              gathering firewood. By far the largest of the three orders.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="text">
            Each castle of the Night's Watch also has a maester assigned to it.
            These maesters take the oath of the Night's Watch and are considered
            full black brothers, but are not considered part of the three
            orders. Given that there were never more than nineteen castles along
            the Wall, there were never more than nineteen maesters in the
            Night's Watch at any one time. Since there are only three active
            castles on the Wall in modern times, there are now only three
            maesters in the Night's Watch at a time.
